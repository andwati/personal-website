Migrating to a better content management system through Netlify CMS

# Heavy Lifting

Setting up Netlify CMS with Hugo is a straightforward process that enhances your static site with a user-friendly content management interface. With Netlify CMS, you can manage your Hugo content directly from a web-based admin panel.

# Redeploying to Netlify

Moving from GitHub Pages to Netlify provides continuous deployment, form handling, and more. The migration process involves connecting your repository to Netlify and configuring the build settings.

# Setting up Netlify CMS

## Steps

1. Create an `admin` folder in your `static` directory
2. Add `index.html` and `config.yml` files
3. Configure the CMS to match your content structure
4. Enable Netlify Identity for authentication
5. Set up Git Gateway for content management

# Setting up a custom domain

Configure your custom domain in Netlify's domain settings and update your DNS records accordingly.
